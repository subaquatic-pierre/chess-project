# Chess Project

## Overview

Chess Project is a comprehensive chess application written in Rust. It consists of two main components: "chess-frontend" and "chess-api." The frontend leverages Rust and WebAssembly (wasm) along with Gatsby.js to create a powerful, interactive user interface for playing chess.

## Sub-Projects

### chess-frontend

The "chess-frontend" sub-project is responsible for the user interface, providing an immersive and dynamic experience for playing chess.

- **Rust, WebAssembly (wasm), and Gatsby.js**: Utilizes Rust and WebAssembly for performance and Gatsby.js for a seamless and modern frontend.
- **Interactive Chessboard**: Offers a user-friendly and interactive chessboard for playing games.

### chess-api

The "chess-api" sub-project focuses on the backend API, handling game logic, and supporting the frontend.

- **RESTful API**: Provides a RESTful API for managing chess games.
- **Game Logic**: Implements the core chess game logic, including moves, captures, and checkmate conditions.
